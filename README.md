# Hatchways Front-End Practice Assessment

## Five Day Forecast Version

This Branch takes the Main branch and expands the code from a single component showing the current temp in a location, to a 5 day forecast for a single location.

The goal of this assessment is to replicate a front-end application presented by hatchways.

It is not graded, but the official assessment will be graded based on the following criteria:

- Correctness: Is your solution complete and does it pass different test cases?
- Code Organization, Readability, & Maintainability: Is your code easy to read and
  well organized?
- Code Performance: Is your code efficient? Did you use appropriate data
  structures?
- Best Practices: Did you utilize good programming practices (avoid anti-patterns)? Did you show a good grasp of your language/framework of choice?
