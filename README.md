# Weather App

## Five Day Forecast

This application uses the openweather API.
Here we request weather information from the api based on a location and the API provides us contextual data.
We store the data into states and then render the data to our application front-end.

Currently I have hard coded the location to Winnipeg, MB where I am located.
